Test driven development:
# Test-driven development (TDD) is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.   
# The goal of TDD is to write clean code that works.(with proper stats) 


Continuous Integration:
# is the process of automating the build (Jenkin)
# and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control. (mvn and arquillian)


Continuous Deployment
# Continuous deployment aims to reduce the time elapsed between writing a line of code 
# and making that code available to users in production.


Arquillian advantage:
# ability to create "micro deployments" around your test.
# can be integrated with browser .
# can debug your micro developed code on same container. 
# Arquillian provides an extensible platform into which you can integrate that next great testing tool. like selenium etc


## 
And this is where Arquillian (and Arquillian Cube) helps you on automating everything.(choose specific env at run time.)
Arquillian Cube is an Arquillian extension that can be used to manager Docker containers from Arquillian.



## No more mocks. No more container lifecycle and deployment hassles. Just real tests!


JEE components:
JSF, EJB, JPA and Hibernate, MDriven beans , rest apis, CDI
spring beans, 
docker supports, 


- Jenkin with take checkout of source code (+ runtime), 
- mvn with create build, 
- arquillian will going to up docker container(+ runtime) where you container will be present,
- and test will result will be prepared
- maintains logs (tools are present)

- micro development and debugging on the basis of some standards.
